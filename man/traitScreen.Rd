\title{Filter prescreened myDNA object filter for trait of interest}
\usage{
traitScreen(myScreenDNA, trait = "all", risk = "high.protective")
}
\arguments{
\item{myScreenDNA}{GRanges object, output of importDNA function}

\item{trait}{(character) which trait are you interested in}

\item{risk}{(character; default "high")
"high" -> OR>=1.5,
 "elavated" -> OR >1&<1.5
 "protective" -> OR >0.75&<1
 "high.protective" -> OR <0.75,}
}
\description{
Filter prescreened myDNA object filter for trait of interest
}
\details{
This function allows you to filter your imported myDNA object +
overlapped with database of interest (GWASCatalog) by selecting trait in
which you are interested in, and selecting category of SNPs. For example,
high risk SNPs are those which have reported OR or beta >1.5.
